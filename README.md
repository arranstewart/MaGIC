A copy of the code and documentation for John Slaney's

## MaGIC homepage

The MaGIC homepage is at http://users.cecs.anu.edu.au/~jks/magic.html.

## MaGIC manual

The link to the MaGIC manual on the MaGIC homepage is broken; the 
correct link is [here](http://ftp.rsise.anu.edu.au/techreports/1995/TR-ARP-11-95.ps.gz), and a local copy is stored in the directory `manual`.
